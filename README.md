# Anna Freud Centre's AIM Questionnaire tools for TiddlyWiki

This repository contains an implementation of the AIM Questionnaire created by the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families in London, UK. The AFNCCF is a charity that provides training and support for organisations providing social care to young people and their families.

You can find out more about AIM [on their site](https://manuals.annafreud.org/ambit/#AIM):

> This is a questionnaire completed by the worker from the workers' perspective
> It provides a holistic measure of client functioning across a range of areas (or domains) of life
> The domains that it measures are: Daily life-function, socio-economic factors, family relationships, social relationships, mental state, clients' response to their situation, and, the complexity of the difficulties
> It can be used as a measure at the beginning and end of work with clients to track how the work has gone, whether the goals set have been met, and whether things have changed in a clients' life. At a service or team level it can provide a rich source of information about the clients that have been seen, and act as a resource for teams to learn about the work they do

The implementation is based on [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/).
