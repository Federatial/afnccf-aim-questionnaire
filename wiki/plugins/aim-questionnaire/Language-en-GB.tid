LabelKeyProblem: This is a key problem (<<key-question-number>> of <<max-key-questions>>)
OverviewSuggestedInterventions: These interventions are suggestions according to the AIM results and are based on available evidence. They are a guide and can be useful as a way of checking that these options have been considered, rather than directing a worker to what they must do.
OverviewSuggestionsFocal: Each suggested intervention is ranked in order of how ''severe'' the set of problems are (their averaged AIM scores) that indicate that particular intervention. This is good for ''focusing on the most severe problems''
OverviewSuggestionsGlobal: Each suggested intervention is ranked according to how many different problems (that is AIM items scoring greater than 2) the young person has which that particular intervention is relevant for. This is good for ''covering the whole set of problems and causes''
OverviewSuggestionsLimit: Limit suggested interventions only to those relevant for items identified as ''key problems''
