!! Introduction

This is an interactive implementation in TiddlyWiki 5 by [[Federatial|https://federatial.com]] of the AMBIT AIM (Adolescent Integrative Measure) Questionnaire developed by the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families in London, UK. The AFNCCF is a charity that provides training and support for organisations providing social care to young people and their families.

* AFNCC is a world-leading mental health charity for children and families that has developed and delivered pioneering mental health care for over 60 years – see https://annafreud.org/
* AMBIT is a mentalization-based approach for teams and services who work with clients presenting with multiple and complex problems – see https://manuals.annafreud.org/ambit/
* The AIM Questionnaire is a questionnaire completed by a care worker from the workers' perspective that systematically analyses the situation of a young person and suggests specific interventions. It can be used as a measure at the beginning and end of work with clients to track how the work has gone, whether the goals set have been met, and whether things have changed in a clients' life. At a service or team level it can provide a rich source of information about the clients that have been seen, and act as a resource for teams to learn about the work they do – see https://manuals.annafreud.org/ambit/#AIM
